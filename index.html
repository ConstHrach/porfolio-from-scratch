        <h2><big><i>About Me</i></big></h2>
        <h3>Hello and welcome to my portfolio. I currently have no projects to display, <br>
            so to compensate let me tell you a little bit about me. I am a 21 year old student <br>
            who is an aspiring software developer. I am currently enrolled in a bootcamp at <br>
            Cal State Long Beach. What I hope to achieve from this bootcamp is to become<br>
            proficient enough to where I can obtain a job in the software developement industry. <br>
            However, even after the bootcamp I will be full committed to learning as much<br>
            as I can and as often as I can because in this field you quite literally learn <br>
            something new everyday.
        </h3>
        <ul style="font-size: 20px;"> What I hope to achieve:
            <li>Be able to make a website from scratch</li>
            <li>Become a job ready Jr. developer</li>
            <li>Soon become a full stack developer</li>
